# Handouts For You.

The main goal of this project was to collate handouts at a place where everyone can access it and search easily. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Scripts

There's a script to parse ps data and there's a script to parse course pre-requisites but I assume you wouldn't need to use the latter. The PS Script converts CSV of responses to the format of minCGPA, maxCGPA and station. There's also a script which parses json to check for duplicate stations.
