# Handouts For You.

The main goal of this project was to collate handouts at a place where everyone can access it and search easily. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Practice School Scripts

1. Download the most up to date copy of **PS2_master.csv**
2. Add the new year to be added to the end of the CSV
3. Run `similar_names_filter` script on this csv to ensure that it gives you all the similar names in that particular csv from the company column
4. This will generate a `soundex_filter.txt` which contains all the companies which are similar in the format of CompanyA<|>CompanyB now the task here is to ensure only those companies which are together are in the same line. For example:

```
National Aerospace Lab<|>National Aerospace Laboratories<|>National Aerospace Laboratory<|>National Chemical Laboratory<|>National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune<|>National Chemical Laboratory - Pune<|>National Chemical Laboratory, Pune<|>National Council for Cement and Building Materials<|>National Council of Applied Economic Research<|>National Instruments<|>National Instruments (Bangalore)<|>National Instruments Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd. - Bengaluru<|>National Instruments, Bangalore
```

should become

```
National Aerospace Lab<|>National Aerospace Laboratories<|>National Aerospace Laboratory

National Chemical Laboratory<|>National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune<|>National Chemical Laboratory - Pune<|>National Chemical Laboratory, Pune

National Council for Cement and Building Materials

National Council of Applied Economic Research

National Instruments<|>National Instruments (Bangalore)<|>National Instruments Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd. - Bengaluru<|>National Instruments, Bangalore
```

5. Now the next step is to run `data_consolidator` script which consolidates all the stations of same name into one station.
   NOTE: Incase you want to ignore two completely dissimilar companies add it to scripts/ignore.txt
6. In the end run `parse_ps` to generate json from csv

## Pre-requisite Courses Script

-   Use this to convert the excel TTD puts out on cms regarding prereqs to a json format
-   I don't think you'll need to use this for a long long time :)
