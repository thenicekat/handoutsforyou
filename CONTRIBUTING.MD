## Pull Request Guidelines

We aim to follow the following standards for PRs

1. build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
2. ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
3. docs: Documentation only changes
4. feat: A new feature
5. fix: A bug fix
6. perf: A code change that improves performance
7. refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
8. style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
9. test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
10. chore: edits to files that aren't src, build, or ci files
